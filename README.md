# 🛒 Shopping List App

This is a shopping list application built with React, utilizing Supabase for user authentication and database management. The application allows users to create and manage shopping lists with different permission levels. Users can also apply filters to search for products, and the app provides a summary of each list, including total price, total weight, and total products.

## 🚀 Features

- CRUD operations for shopping lists and products: create, read, update, and delete.
- Adding, removing, and modifying products in lists.
- Creating, deleting, and modifying products, restricted to administrators.
- Filtering products based on various criteria.
- Summary view for each list, displaying total price, total weight, total products, and a recommendation on whether to use a car for transportation.

## 📌 Note

- This project is a practice assignment for my higher vocational training in web application development.
- If the project does not work, it might be because Supabase deactivates databases after one week of inactivity. If you want to test it with my database, please contact me via my social media, and I will activate it if needed.
